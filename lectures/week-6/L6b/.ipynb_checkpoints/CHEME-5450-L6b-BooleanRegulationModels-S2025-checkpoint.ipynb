    "# L6b: Incorporating Gene Expression Logic into Flux Balance Analysis\n",
    "In this lecture, we'll continue our discussion of Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), particularly what the constraints are saying in the flux estimation problem. Last time, we simplified the material balance and flux bounds constraints. Today, we'll discuss incorporating gene expression logic into the FBA problem. The key ideas of this lecture are:\n",
    "* __Flux balance analysis (FBA)__ is a mathematical approach used to analyze the flow of metabolites through a metabolic network. It assumes a steady state where metabolite production, consumption, and transport rates are balanced. The FBA problem is formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem to maximize or minimize fluxes through the network, subject to constraints. \n",
    "* __Flux bounds constraints__ limit the range of possible fluxes through a metabolic network. These bounds can incorporate additional information, such as experimental data or prior knowledge about the system, into the FBA problem.\n",
    "* __Boolean gene expression logic__ can be incorporated into the FBA problem by using gene-protein-reaction (GPR) rules to link gene expression levels to enzyme activity and metabolic fluxes. GPR rules define the relationship between genes, proteins, and reactions in a metabolic network, allowing for the integration of gene expression data into the FBA model. The GPR rules are logical expressions in [a boolean model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra)."

    "## PS2 (Preview): Flux Balance Analysis of the Urea Cycle in HL-60 Cells\n",
    "In problem set 2 (PS2), we will explore the urea cycle in HL-60 cells using flux balance analysis. The [urea cycle](https://www.kegg.jp/pathway/hsa00220) is a crucial metabolic pathway that converts toxic ammonia into urea for excretion. While the urea cycle's role in [HL-60 cells, a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line](https://www.atcc.org/products/ccl-240?matchtype=b&network=g&device=c&adposition=&keyword=hl60%20cell%20line%20atcc&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADR6fpoOXsp8U8fXLd_E6sLTcwv24&gclid=CjwKCAiA5eC9BhAuEiwA3CKwQm0C1oE5_JjTpJ24VnTjZUZQVLivpPxmufDo7HdH5v3hN1XKnEf3ExoCvhwQAvD_BwE), is not directly established, these cells exhibit alterations in protein levels and proliferation rates when exposed to various compounds, which may indirectly affect nitrogen metabolism and related pathways.\n",
