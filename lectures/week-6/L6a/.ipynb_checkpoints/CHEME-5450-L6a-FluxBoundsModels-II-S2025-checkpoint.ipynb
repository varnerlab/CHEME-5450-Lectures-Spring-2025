    "# L6a: Incorportaing Gene Expression Logic into Flux Balance Analysis\n",
    "In this lecture, we'll continue our discussion of Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), and oarticularly what the contraints are saying in the flux estimation problem. Last time we simplified the matreial balance constraints, and the flux bounds constraints. Today, we'll talk about how we can incorporate gene expression logic into the FBA problem. The key ideas of this lecture are:\n",
    "* __Flux balance analysis (FBA)__ is a mathematical approach used to analyze the flow of metabolites through a metabolic network. It assumes a steady state where metabolite production, consumption, and transport rates are balanced. The FBA problem is formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem to maximize or minimize fluxes through the network, subject to constraints. \n",
    "* __Flux bounds constraints__ limit the range of possible fluxes through a metabolic network. These bounds can incorporate additional information, such as experimental data or prior knowledge about the system, into the FBA problem.\n",
    "* __Gene expression logic__ can be incorporated into the FBA problem by using gene-protein-reaction (GPR) rules to link gene expression levels to enzyme activity and metabolic fluxes. GPR rules define the relationship between genes, proteins, and reactions in a metabolic network, allowing for the integration of gene expression data into the FBA model.\n",

    "## A model for flux bounds\n",
    "The flux bounds are important constraints in flux balance analysis calculations and the convex decomposition of the stoichiometric array. Beyond their role in the flux estimation problem, the flux bounds are _integrative_, i.e., these constraints integrate many types of genetic and biochemical information into the problem. A general model for these bounds is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "-\\delta_{j}\\underbrace{\\left[{V_{max,j}^{\\circ}}\\left(\\frac{e}{e^{\\circ}}\\right)\\theta_{j}\\left(\\dots\\right){f_{j}\\left(\\dots\\right)}\\right]}_{\\text{reverse: other functions or parameters?}}\\leq\\hat{v}_{j}\\leq{V_{max,j}^{\\circ}}\\left(\\frac{e}{e^{\\circ}}\\right)\\theta_{j}\\left(\\dots\\right){f_{j}\\left(\\dots\\right)}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $V_{max,j}^{\\circ}$ denotes the maximum reaction velocity (units: `flux`) computed at some _characteristic enzyme abundance_. Thus, the maximum reaction velocity is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_{max,j}^{\\circ} \\equiv k_{cat,j}^{\\circ}e^{\\circ}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $k_{cat,j}$ is the catalytic constant or turnover number for the enzyme (units: `1/time`) and $e^{\\circ}$ is a characteristic enzyme abundance (units: `concentration`). The term $\\left(e/e^{\\circ}\\right)$ is a correction to account for the _actual_ enzyme abundance catalyzing the reaction (units: `dimensionless`). The $\\theta_{j}\\left(\\dots\\right)\\in\\left[0,1\\right]$ is the current fraction of maximial enzyme activity of enzyme $e$ in reaction $j$. The activity model $\\theta_{j}\\left(\\dots\\right)$ describes [allosteric effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allosteric_regulation) on the reaction rate, and is a function of the regulatory and the chemical state of the system, the concentration of substrates, products, and cofactors (units: `dimensionless`).\n",
    "Finally, the $f_{j}\\left(\\dots\\right)$ is a function describing the substrate (reactants) dependence of the reaction rate $j$ (units: `dimensionless`). \n",

In addition, the $\\theta_{j}\\left(\\dots\\right)$ and $f_{j}\\left(\\dots\\right)$ models can also have associated parameters, e.g., saturation or binding constants, etc. Thus, we need to estimate these from literature studies or experimental data.\n",
    "* __Reversibility__: Next, we need to estimate the binary direction parameter $\\delta_{j}\\in\\left\\{0,1\\right\\}$. The value of $\\delta_{j}$ describes the reversibility of reaction $j$; if reaction $j$ is __reversible__ $\\delta_{j}=1$. If reaction $j$ is __irreversible__ $\\delta_{j}=0$\n",
    "\n",

    "### Simplfied bounds model\n",
    "Let's initially assume that $(e/e^{\\circ})\\sim{1}$, there are no allosteric inputs $\\theta_{j}\\left(\\dots\\right)\\sim{1}$, and the substrates are saturating $f_{j}\\left(\\dots\\right)\\sim{1}$. \n",
    "Then, the flux bounds are given by:\n",
    "$$\n",

    "-\\delta_{j}V_{max,j}^{\\circ}\\leq{\\hat{v}_{j}}\\leq{V_{max,j}^{\\circ}}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is a simple model for the flux bounds. It is easy to see that the flux bounds are a function of the maximum reaction velocity, the catalytic constant or turnover number, and our assumed value of a characteristic enzyme abundance."
