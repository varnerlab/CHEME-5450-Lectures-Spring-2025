    "## A model for flux bounds\n",
    "The flux bounds are important constraints in flux balance analysis calculations and the convex decomposition of the stoichiometric array. Beyond their role in the flux estimation problem, the flux bounds are _integrative_, i.e., these constraints integrate many types of genetic and biochemical information into the flux estimation problem. A general model for these bounds is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "-\\delta_{j}\\underbrace{\\left[{V_{max,j}^{\\circ}}\\left(\\frac{e}{e^{\\circ}}\\right)\\theta_{j}\\left(\\dots\\right){f_{j}\\left(\\dots\\right)}\\right]}_{\\text{reverse: other functions or parameters?}}\\leq\\hat{v}_{j}\\leq{V_{max,j}^{\\circ}}\\left(\\frac{e}{e^{\\circ}}\\right)\\theta_{j}\\left(\\dots\\right){f_{j}\\left(\\dots\\right)}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "where $V_{max,j}^{\\circ}$ denotes the maximum reaction velocity (units: `flux`) computed at some _characteristic enzyme abundance_. Thus, the maximum reaction velocity is given by:\n",

    "V_{max,j}^{\\circ} = k_{cat,j}^{\\circ}e^{\\circ}\n",

The term $\\left(e/e^{\\circ}\\right)$ is a correction to account for the _actual_ enzyme abundance catalyzing the reaction (units: `dimensioness`). The $\\theta_{j}\\left(\\dots\\right)\\in\\left[0,1\\right]$ is the current fraction of maximial enzyme activity of enzyme $e$ in reaction $j$. The activity model $\\theta_{j}\\left(\\dots\\right)$ describes [allosteric effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allosteric_regulation) on the reaction rate, and is a function of the regulatory and the chemical state of the system, the concentration of substrates, products, and cofactors (units: `dimensionless`).\n",

    "\n",
    "* __Parameters__: We need estimates for the $k_{cat,j}^{\\circ}$ for all enzymes in the system we are interested in, and a _reasonable policy_ for specifying a charactertic value for $e^{\\circ}$. In addition, the $\\theta_{j}\\left(\\dots\\right)$ and $f_{j}\\left(\\dots\\right)$ models can also have associated parameters, e.g., saturation or binding constants, etc. Thus, we need to estimate these from literature studies or experimental data.\n",
