    "When doing FBA, we often will make three assumptions:\n",
    "* __Steady-state, constant volume__: The biological system (or at least part of it) is in a steady state, and in whole-cell models, the volume of the culture is constant. However, this is not the case in fed-batch cultures; many industrial biotechnology processes operate in fed-batch mode. \n",
    "* __Specific units__: The volume basis for the _intracellular_ species concentrations is in specific units, i.e., per unit cell mass measured in grams dry weight (units: `gDW`). For cell-free systems, the volume basis is the volume of the reactor.\n",
    "* __No transport or dilution terms__: We will assume that there are no physical transport or dilution terms in the material balance equations. This is a simplification, but it is often used in FBA. For example, this assumption is not the case for continuous cell-free systems.\n",

    "Great! So then, does everything in our system have to be at a steady state? Not exactly.  \n",

The exchange of material with the surroundings is captured in the context of our three assumptions by writing _hypothetical reactions_ that exchange material with the surroundings.
