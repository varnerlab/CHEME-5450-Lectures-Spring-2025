    "# L4c: Metabolic Networks and the Stoichiometric Matrix\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this lecture, we will begin our discussion of metabolism and metabolic networks, and in particular, we'll introduce the stoichiometric matrix and analyze its properties. The key ideas that we will discuss in this lecture include:\n",
    "* __Metabolism and metabolic networks__: A metabolic network is the complete set of metabolic (chemical) processes determining a cell's biochemical state. It encompasses all the chemical reactions associated with metabolism, i.e., the breakdown of raw materials such as sugars (catabolism) and the production of macromolecules, e.g., proteins, lipids, etc (anabolism).\n",
    "* __A stoichiometric matrix__ is a mathematical representation of a metabolic network that encodes the relationships between reactants and products in a metabolic network, where rows correspond to different metabolites, contained in the set $\\mathcal{M}$, and columns correspond to reactions, contained in the set $\\mathcal{R}$. Thus, the stoichiometric matrix is a $\\mathbf{S}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{M}|\\times|\\mathcal{R}|}$ matrix holding the stochiometric coefficients $\\sigma_{ij}\\in\\mathbf{S}$ for $i=1,2,\\dots,|\\mathcal{M}|$ and $j=1,2,\\dots,|\\mathcal{R}|$.\n",
    "* __Structural analysis of $\\mathbf{S}$__: Structural analysis of the stoichiometric matrix involves examining its connectivity distribution and using tools such as eigendecomposition to explore the network's fundamental pathway structures and other topological properties. These type of analyses give us some more insight into the structure of the network (and perhaps some indication of importance of particular metabolites of reactions).\n",

    "* __Diagonal elements__:The elements along the central diagonal $c_{ii}\\in\\mathbf{C}_{r}$ are the total number of reactants and products of a particular reaction.

    "## Other ways to estimate important reactions (metabolites)?\n",
    "We imposed the idea that connectivity is proportional to importance; what if this isn't the case? Could we have the stoichiometric matrix tell us what is important? Yes! We could decompose the stoichiometric matrix using tools from [eigendecomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix#). But there is a _gotcha_: the stoichiometric matrix is not _square_. Thus, we cannot directly compute its [eigendecomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix#).\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Idea__: Let's compute a square matrix that measures the _similarity_ of reactions (or metabolites) using a measure such as the [covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix) or a [kernel function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method). This gives us an idea about the relationship between the network's reactions (or metabolites) $i$ and $j$. Then, we can decompose that and look at the [eigenvalues and eigenvectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors) to see what we can see. In particular, we'll look at the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "For giggles, let's propose [a kernel function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method) to compute the _similarity_ of the rows (metabolites) or the columns (reactions) and save it in the `k(x,y)::Function` variable:"
