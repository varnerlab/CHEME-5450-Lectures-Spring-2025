	abstract = {The present work integrates the multiscale transform provided by the wavelets and singular value decomposition (SVD) for the detection of anomaly in self-similar network data. The algorithm proposed in this paper uses the properties of singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix whose elements are local energies of wavelet coefficients at different scales. Unlike existing techniques, our method determines both the presence (i.e., the time intervals in which anomaly occurs) and the nature of anomaly (i.e., anomaly of bursty type, long or short duration, etc.) in network data. It uses the diagonal, left and right singular matrices obtained in SVD to determine the number of scales of self-similarity, location and scales of anomaly in data, respectively. Our simulation work on different data sets demonstrates that the method performs better than the existing anomaly detection methods proposed for self-similar data.},

	abstract = {We describe the use of singular value decomposition in transforming genome-wide expression data from genes x arrays space to reduced diagonalized "eigengenes" x "eigenarrays" space, where the eigengenes (or eigenarrays) are unique orthonormal superpositions of the genes (or arrays). Normalizing the data by filtering out the eigengenes (and eigenarrays) that are inferred to represent noise or experimental artifacts enables meaningful comparison of the expression of different genes across different arrays in different experiments. Sorting the data according to the eigengenes and eigenarrays gives a global picture of the dynamics of gene expression, in which individual genes and arrays appear to be classified into groups of similar regulation and function, or similar cellular state and biological phenotype, respectively. After normalization and sorting, the significant eigengenes and eigenarrays can be associated with observed genome-wide effects of regulators, or with measured samples, in which these regulators are overactive or underactive, respectively.},

	abstract = {We describe the singular value decomposition (SVD) of yeast genome-scale mRNA lengths distribution data measured by DNA microarrays. SVD uncovers in the mRNA abundance levels data matrix of genes × arrays, i.e., electrophoretic gel migration lengths or mRNA lengths, mathematically unique decorrelated and decoupled ``eigengenes.'' The eigengenes are the eigenvectors of the arrays × arrays correlation matrix, with the corresponding series of eigenvalues proportional to the series of the ``fractions of eigen abundance.'' Each fraction of eigen abundance indicates the significance of the corresponding eigengene relative to all others. We show that the eigengenes fit ``asymmetric Hermite functions,'' a generalization of the eigenfunctions of the quantum harmonic oscillator and the integral transform which kernel is a generalized coherent state. The fractions of eigen abundance fit a geometric series as do the eigenvalues of the integral transform which kernel is a generalized coherent state. The ``asymmetric generalized coherent state'' models the measured data, where the profiles of mRNA abundance levels of most genes as well as the distribution of the peaks of these profiles fit asymmetric Gaussians. We hypothesize that the asymmetry in the distribution of the peaks of the profiles is due to two competing evolutionary forces. We show that the asymmetry in the profiles of the genes might be due to a previously unknown asymmetry in the gel electrophoresis thermal broadening of a moving, rather than a stationary, band of RNA molecules.},

@article{Villadsen1997,
	abstract = {Abstract Within the last decades NMR spectroscopy has undergone tremendous development and has become a powerful analytical tool for the investigation of intracellular flux distributions in biochemical networks using 13C-labeled substrates. Not only are the experiments much easier to conduct than experiments employing radioactive tracer elements, but NMR spectroscopy also provides additional information on the labeling pattern of the metabolites. Whereas the maximum amount of information obtainable with 14C-labeled substrates is the fractional enrichment in the individual carbon atom positions, NMR spectroscopy can also provide information on the degree of labeling at neighboring carbon atom positions by analyzing multiplet patterns in NMR spectra or using 2-dimensional NMR spectra. It is possible to quantify the mole fractions of molecules that show a specific labeling pattern, i.e., information of the isotopomer distribution in metabolite pools can be obtained. The isotopomer distribution is the maximum amount of information that in theory can be obtained from 13C-tracer studies. The wealth of information contained in NMR spectra frequently leads to overdetermined algebraic systems. Consequently, fluxes must be estimated by nonlinear least squares analysis, in which experimental labeling data is compared with simulated steady state isotopomer distributions. Hence, mathematical models are required to compute the steady state isotopomer distribution as a function of a given set of steady state fluxes. Because 2n possible labeling patterns exist in a molecule of n carbon atoms, and each pattern corresponds to a separate state in the isotopomer model, these models are inherently complex. Model complexity, so far, has restricted usage of isotopomer information to relatively small metabolic networks. A general methodology for the formulation of isotopomer models is described. The model complexity of isotopomer models is reduced to that of classical metabolic models by expressing the 2n isotopomer mass balances of a metabolite pool in a single matrix equation. Using this approach an isotopomer model has been implemented that describes label distribution in primary carbon metabolism, i.e., in a metabolic network including the Embden--Meyerhof--Parnas and pentose phosphate pathway, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and selected anaplerotic reaction sequences. The model calculates the steady state label distribution in all metabolite pools as a function of the steady state fluxes and is applied to demonstrate the effect of selected anaplerotic fluxes on the labeling pattern of the pathway intermediates. {\copyright} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

The latter include the findings of the lack of activity of glyoxylate shunt, and that phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PPC) is the only anaplerotic reaction expressed in C. glutamicum cultivated on glucose minimal media. Network simplifications afforded by the above findings facilitated the determination of metabolic flux distributions under a variety of culture conditions and led to the following conclusions.

	abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic networks can be reconstructed. The systemic biochemical properties of these networks can now be studied. Here, genome-scale reconstructed metabolic networks were analysed using singular value decomposition (SVD). All the individual biochemical conversions contained in a reconstructed metabolic network are described by a stoichiometric matrix (S). SVD of S led to the definition of the underlying modes that characterize the overall biochemical conversions that take place in a network and rank-ordered their importance. The modes were shown to correspond to systemic biochemical reactions and they could be used to identify the groups and clusters of individual biochemical reactions that drive them. Comparative analysis of the Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Helicobacter pylori genome-scale metabolic networks showed that the four dominant modes in all three networks correspond to: (1) the conversion of ATP to ADP, (2) redox metabolism of NADP, (3) proton-motive force, and (4) inorganic phosphate metabolism. The sets of individual metabolic reactions deriving these systemic conversions, however, differed among the three organisms. Thus, we can now define systemic metabolic reactions, or eigen-reactions, for the study of systems biology of metabolism and have a basis for comparing the overall properties of genome-specific metabolic networks.},

	abstract = {It is now possible to construct genome-scale metabolic networks for particular microorganisms. Extreme pathway analysis is a useful method for analyzing the phenotypic capabilities of these networks. Many extreme pathways are needed to fully describe the functional capabilities of genome-scale metabolic networks, and therefore, a need exists to develop methods to study these large sets of extreme pathways. Singular value decomposition (SVD) of matrices of extreme pathways was used to develop a conceptual framework for the interpretation of large sets of extreme pathways and the steady-state flux solution space they define. The key results of this study were: 1), convex steady-state solution cones describing the potential functions of biochemical networks can be studied using the modes generated by SVD; 2), Helicobacter pylori has a more rigid metabolic network (i.e., a lower dimensional solution space and a more dominant first singular value) than Haemophilus influenzae for the production of amino acids; and 3), SVD allows for direct comparison of different solution cones resulting from the production of different amino acids. SVD was used to identify key network branch points that may identify key control points for regulation. Therefore, SVD of matrices of extreme pathways has proved to be a useful method for analyzing the steady-state solution space of genome-scale metabolic networks.},

	abstract = {Constraint-based metabolic modeling has been used to capture the genome-scale, systems properties of an organism's metabolism. The first generation of these models has been built on annotated gene sequence. To further this field, we now need to develop methods to incorporate additional "omic" data types including transcriptomics, metabolomics, and fluxomics to further facilitate the construction, validation, and predictive capabilities of these models. The work herein combines metabolic flux data with an in silico model of central metabolism of Escherichia coli for model centric integration of the flux data. The extreme pathways for this network, which define the allowable solution space for all possible flux distributions, are analyzed using the alpha-spectrum. The alpha-spectrum determines which extreme pathways can and cannot contribute to the metabolic flux distribution for a given condition and gives the allowable range of weightings on each extreme pathway that can contribute. Since many extreme pathways cannot be used under certain conditions, the result is a "condition-specific" solution space that is a subset of the original solution space. The alpha-spectrum results are used to create a "condition-specific" extreme pathway matrix that can be analyzed using singular value decomposition (SVD). The first mode of the SVD analysis characterizes the solution space for a given condition. We show that SVD analysis of the alpha-spectrum extreme pathway matrix that incorporates measured uptake and byproduct secretion rates, can predict internal flux trends for different experimental conditions. These predicted internal flux trends are, in general, consistent with the flux trends measured using experimental metabolic flux analysis techniques.},

	abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic networks can be reconstructed. The systemic biochemical properties of these networks can now be studied. Here, genome-scale reconstructed metabolic networks were analysed using singular value decomposition (SVD). All the individual biochemical conversions contained in a reconstructed metabolic network are described by a stoichiometric matrix (S). SVD of S led to the definition of the underlying modes that characterize the overall biochemical conversions that take place in a network and rank-ordered their importance. The modes were shown to correspond to systemic biochemical reactions and they could be used to identify the groups and clusters of individual biochemical reactions that drive them. Comparative analysis of the Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Helicobacter pylori genome-scale metabolic networks showed that the four dominant modes in all three networks correspond to: (1) the conversion of ATP to ADP, (2) redox metabolism of NADP, (3) proton-motive force, and (4) inorganic phosphate metabolism. The sets of individual metabolic reactions deriving these systemic conversions, however, differed among the three organisms. Thus, we can now define systemic metabolic reactions, or eigen-reactions, for the study of systems biology of metabolism and have a basis for comparing the overall properties of genome-specific metabolic networks.},

@article{Barrett:2006aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extreme pathways (ExPas) have been shown to be valuable for studying the functions and capabilities of metabolic networks through characterization of the null space of the stoichiometric matrix (S). Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the ExPa matrix P has previously been used to characterize the metabolic regulatory problem in the human red blood cell (hRBC) from a network perspective. The calculation of ExPas is NP-hard, and for genome-scale networks the computation of ExPas has proven to be infeasible. Therefore an alternative approach is needed to reveal regulatory properties of steady state solution spaces of genome-scale stoichiometric matrices.
RESULTS: We show that the SVD of a matrix (W) formed of random samples from the steady-state solution space of the hRBC metabolic network gives similar insights into the regulatory properties of the network as was obtained with SVD of P. This new approach has two main advantages. First, it works with a direct representation of the shape of the metabolic solution space without the confounding factor of a non-uniform distribution of the extreme pathways and second, the SVD procedure can be applied to a very large number of samples, such as will be produced from genome-scale networks.
CONCLUSION: These results show that we are now in a position to study the network aspects of the regulatory problem in genome-scale metabolic networks through the use of random sampling.},

@article{Price:2003aa,
	abstract = {Reconstruction of cell-scale metabolic networks is now possible. A description of allowable metabolic network functions can be obtained using extreme pathways, which are the convex basis vectors of the solution space containing all steady state flux distributions. However, only a portion of these allowable network functions are physiologically possible due to kinetic and regulatory constraints. Methods are now needed that enable us to take a defined metabolic network and deduce candidate regulatory structures that control the selection of these physiologically relevant states. One such approach is the singular value decomposition (SVD) of extreme pathway matrices (P), which allows for the characterization of steady state solution spaces. Eigenpathways, which are the left singular vectors from the SVD of P, can be described and categorized by their biochemical function. SVD of P for the human red blood cell showed that the first five eigenpathways, out of a total of 23, effectively characterize all the relevant physiological states of red blood cell metabolism calculated with a detailed kinetic model. Thus, with five degrees of freedom the magnitude and nature of the regulatory needs are defined. Additionally, the dominant features of these first five eigenpathways described key metabolic splits that are indeed regulated in the human red blood cell. The extreme pathway matrix is derived directly from network topology and only knowledge of Vmax values is needed to reach these conclusions. Thus, we have implemented a network-based analysis of regulation that complements the study of individual regulatory events. This topological approach may provide candidate regulatory structures for metabolic networks with known stoichiometry but poorly characterized regulation.},

Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.},

A detailed analogy with annealing in solids provides a framework for optimization of the properties of very large and complex systems. This connection to statistical mechanics exposes new information and provides an unfamiliar perspective on traditional optimization problems and methods.},

@article{SG2019,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Following visible successes on a wide range of predictive tasks, machine learning techniques are attracting substantial interest from medical researchers and clinicians. We address the need for capacity development in this area by providing a conceptual introduction to machine learning alongside a practical guide to developing and evaluating predictive algorithms using freely-available open source software and public domain data. METHODS: We demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques by developing three predictive models for cancer diagnosis using descriptions of nuclei sampled from breast masses. These algorithms include regularized General Linear Model regression (GLMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a radial basis function kernel, and single-layer Artificial Neural Networks. The publicly-available dataset describing the breast mass samples (N=683) was randomly split into evaluation (n=456) and validation (n=227) samples. We trained algorithms on data from the evaluation sample before they were used to predict the diagnostic outcome in the validation dataset. We compared the predictions made on the validation datasets with the real-world diagnostic decisions to calculate the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the three models. We explored the use of averaging and voting ensembles to improve predictive performance. We provide a step-by-step guide to developing algorithms using the open-source R statistical programming environment. RESULTS: The trained algorithms were able to classify cell nuclei with high accuracy (.94 -.96), sensitivity (.97 -.99), and specificity (.85 -.94). Maximum accuracy (.96) and area under the curve (.97) was achieved using the SVM algorithm. Prediction performance increased marginally (accuracy =.97, sensitivity =.99, specificity =.95) when algorithms were arranged into a voting ensemble. CONCLUSIONS: We use a straightforward example to demonstrate the theory and practice of machine learning for clinicians and medical researchers. The principals which we demonstrate here can be readily applied to other complex tasks including natural language processing and image recognition.},

@article{Francis-QR-1962,
	abstract = {The QR transformation is an analogue to the LR transformation (Rutishauser, 1958) based on unitary transformations. Both these transformations are global iterative methods for finding the eigenvalues of a matrix, the matrix converging in general to triangular form. In Par t1 of this paper the QR transformation was briefly described and we were then principally concerned with proving convergence, the main result being expressed in theorem 3. We also showed that if the matrix is first reduced to almost triangular form important advantages are gained (further advantages will become apparent) and we gave in outline a way in which convergence could be improved. In this part of the paper we consider the practical application of the QR transformation. Two versions of the algorithm have been programmed for the Pegasus computer; these are described and an attempt is made to evaluate the method. Some results and detailed algorithms are given in appendices. Part 1 was published on pp. 265--71 of this volume (Oct. 61).},

@article{Francis-QR-1961,
	abstract = {The LR transformation, due to Rutishauser, has proved to be a powerful method for finding the eigenvalues of symmetric band matrices. Little attention, however, has been paid to its application to the more difficult problem of finding eigenvalues of general unsymmetric matrices. If the matrices are large two important difficulties are likely to occur. Firstly, triangular decomposition, which is the basis of the method, is by no means always numerically stable, and secondly, the amount of computation required by the method is likely to be very great. This paper describes an algorithm similar to the LR transformation except that the transformations involved in it are all unitary and can thus be expected to by numerically stable. It is then shown that there are various advantages in first converting the matrix to almost-triangular form; in particular, the amount of work involved in the algorithm can then be greatly reduced.Part 1 of the paper is largely concerned with proof of convergence, and the theoretical aspect. Part 2, to be published in January, discussed practical computation and gives results of experiments.},
